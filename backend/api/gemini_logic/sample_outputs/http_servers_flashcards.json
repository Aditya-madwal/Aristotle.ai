  "overview": "HTTP servers are the backbone of the web, responsible for receiving HTTP requests from clients (like web browsers) and sending back HTTP responses, which typically include the requested resource like an HTML page.  They manage client connections, handle various HTTP methods, and play a crucial role in delivering web content.",
